Experience: Dominant in Javascript, HTML, and CSS; Medium experience with Python; Little experience with Java, C++, C, Swift.
Reasons for Taking the Class: I want to sharpen my computer science skills and learn more about theories and algorithims (such as Leet Code type problems).
Other interests: Neuroscience, AI/ML/Neural-Networks (even though I have never done this before, I am quite fascinated with it).
Goals: To look at Stackoverflow signigicantly less, be more "handy" with programming (more general/overall knowledge in app/program development).
